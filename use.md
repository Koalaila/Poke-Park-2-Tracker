# PokePal is an interactive Console App that allows you to look up information about PokePark 2 on the fly!
### Here's how to use it...

1. Download the zip and extract
2. Download the latest .NET (recommended .NET is .NET 8.0 as I have not experimented with .NET 9.0)
3. Go into a shell and CD to the folder that the extracted zip is in
4. Run using command `dotnet run`



Features that will be added later on
- More things to track in the 100%
- A joke bot
- File Read and Write with the information given
